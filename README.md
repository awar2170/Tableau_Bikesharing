## Purpose 
THe purpose of this project was to analyze the August data from the [Citi Bike program](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) in New York City to see if it's worth investing in a bike share program.

## Results 

Checkout Times for Users

This graph shows that the maximum trip duration was 5 minutes and 39 seconds.

Checkout Times for Users by Gender

This graph shows that males are more likely to use the bikes than females.

Trips by Weekday

This shows that the most frequent use of the bikes are through M-F at 8am, then the seconard general peak hour is 5-6pm M-F.  This is most likely due to people who work in the city taking the bikes to work.  The secondary peak hours are during noon on the weekend, and that is most likely people who are using the bikes for recreation.

Trips by Weekday by Gender

This heatmap reinforces what the Checkout Times for Users by Gender graph displays.  More males tend to use these bikes than women.  There may be a number of reasons for this, but more research would have to be done into this data to form any additional substantial conclusions.

User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This graph distingushes between genders, their subscribition status, their gender and how they use the bikes.  It appears that males who are subscribed are the most frequent users of these bikes.  They still appear to use them strongly throughout M-F.  This is most likely due to the general work schedule, which we see in the Trips by Weekday graph.  For some reason Thursdays appear to be extremely popular, and this could be a point of additional research.

## Summary 
Based on the results above, it appears that checking out a bike is a fast process, taking about 5 minutes to do.  Furthermore, males appear to use this resource more than females.  Lastly, this resource is mostly used during peak work traveling hours by both males and females who most likely use this resource to travel to work.
